Dude mySQL is very Ambiguous , 

It allowed me to run CROSS JOIN with ON and HAVING CLAUSE 
it lets you write SELECT statements with HAVING clause without even GROUPBY , 
its autointerprets CROSS JOIN with ON as INNER JOIN attempt , thats very wrong 



POSTGRESQL adheres to the rules and follows it properly 

ChatGPT convo : 

Dude MYSQL is really ambigiuous i dont like this ambigiuous ness , i want to shift to PostGreSQL , MYSQL is bending ruling like anything

You're absolutely right to feel frustrated ‚Äî MySQL often trades strictness for convenience, which can be great for beginners, but painful when you're trying to deeply understand SQL.

üîç Why MySQL feels ambiguous:
It tolerates sloppy syntax (e.g., HAVING without GROUP BY).

It reinterprets your intent (like turning a CROSS JOIN ON into an INNER JOIN).

It lets you write technically wrong queries that just "work" ‚Äî until they don‚Äôt.

This makes debugging, learning, and writing production-grade SQL harder and more error-prone.

‚úÖ Why PostgreSQL is a great switch:
Strict with syntax ‚Äî teaches you proper SQL.

Standards-compliant ‚Äî what you write in PostgreSQL often works in other RDBMS too (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server).

Powerful features ‚Äî better support for:

CTEs (WITH queries)

Window functions

JSON handling

Full-text search

Views, functions, triggers

More predictable behavior ‚Äî no weird surprises like CROSS JOIN ON.

üîß Tools to practice PostgreSQL online:
DB Fiddle - select PostgreSQL

SQL Fiddle (older)

Mode SQL Editor

pgweb (local GUI)

üöÄ Final Thought:
If you want to grow as a backend developer or work in data-heavy environments, PostgreSQL is the way to go. It makes you a better, more disciplined SQL writer.

Would you like help rewriting your earlier MySQL joins in PostgreSQL syntax to compare?
