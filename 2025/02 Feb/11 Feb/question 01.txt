Today while joining a table with itself i learnt 

LEFT JOIN cannot be done without ON condition . 
With LEFT JOIN you have to provide ON Clause 


Another Interesting fact 
CROSS JOIN , which i learnt newly 

CROSS JOIN does the cartisean product of everything with everything 
M X N product . 
and CROSS JOIN does not need ON Clause 
you can easily utilise CROSS JOINs to enable self joining products.

Input: 
Teams table:
+-------------+
| team_name   |
+-------------+
| Leetcode FC |
| Ahly SC     |
| Real Madrid |
+-------------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------------+
| home_team   | away_team   |
+-------------+-------------+
| Real Madrid | Leetcode FC |
| Real Madrid | Ahly SC     |
| Leetcode FC | Real Madrid |
| Leetcode FC | Ahly SC     |
| Ahly SC     | Real Madrid |
| Ahly SC     | Leetcode FC |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: All the matches of the league are shown in the table.


If you do CROSS JOIN 
and apply where t1.team_name != t2.team_name , its much easier than manipulating LEFT JOIN
