Found a Sexy way to write SQL query . 


Question : 

Two tables are given to you Customers and Orders 

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+


We have to output name of those customers who never order , 

i.e whose entry is not present in the Orders Table : 


How I did it using Left Join 

Select c.name from Customers c 
Left Join Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId ----> this means those who will have no entry in orders table will have NULL customerId 
where o.customerId is NULL 



This works fine , but i saw a new way of combining two queries , mind was blown ,


SELECT c.name AS Customers FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN   ----> this query picks customeriD FROM cUSTOMERS and checks for those not in Orders table 
(
    SELECT customerId FROM Orders  ----> Inner query brings result from Customers Table and Finds all the customerId in the orderTable
);

I like this approach
