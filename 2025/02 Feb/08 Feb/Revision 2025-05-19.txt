Question 2

Select e.id , e.name From Employee e 
Inner Join Employee m
on e.managerID = m.id
Where e.salary > m.salary;


Well i forgot that query can be written like this as well 

select e.name AS Employee 
from Employee e , Employee m 
where e.managerId = m.id and e.salary > m.salary;

for (Employee e : employees) {  // Outer Loop: Employees
            for (Employee m : employees) {  // Inner Loop: Managers
                if (e.managerId != null && e.managerId.equals(m.id) && e.salary > m.salary) {
                    result.add(e.name);
                }
            }
        }
