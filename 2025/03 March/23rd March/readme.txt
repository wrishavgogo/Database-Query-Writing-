Learnt about a new thing , if you want to order by multiple things in sql just like composite comparator , 
you can use "," separated order bys


ORDER BY passedSolutions DESC , minSubmissionTime ASC 

it will first do tie breaking on the person who has solved more number of problems , and then on minSubmission time
